**Revest VeFPIS for Frax Build 2023**

This BUIDL builds on the vesting/yield system of veFPIS from the Frax Ecosystem, using Revest core technology. The product allows users to deposit FPIS into the veFPIS vault and receive an FNFT (Financial FNFT) as a record of their deposit (amount, timelock, and even yield calculated in real-time). Users can deposit additional amounts, extend their locking time, and claim yield natively from their FNFTs. As the veFPIS balance is attached to the FNFT's smart wallet address, users are able to sell or lend their veFPIS positions to others.
